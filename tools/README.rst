Tools for the package setup and development

All scripts, which are intended to be use in the development/deployment process
are located here, unless they belong in the docs/ or tests/ directories.

Makefile is not located here, but heavily relies on the scripts in this directory.

All scripts are intended to be run from the root directory of the project.
