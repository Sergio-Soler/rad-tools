Whats new?
----------
Rewrite the internals of the ``ExchangeModel``.

The idea is to allow one to modify the model with respect to the expected symmetry, desired accuracy of the parameters.
The distances of the bonds are not directly read from the TB2J exchange file, but computed based on the atoms's positions.
``Bond`` class is independent of the distance. 
When exchange model is read from the TB2J exchange file the order of bonds is kept as the insert order of the python's dicts.
