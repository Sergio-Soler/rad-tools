Whats new?
----------
Rewrite the internals of the 
:doc:`ExchangeModel <../api/_autosummary/rad_tools.exchange.model.ExchangeModel>`.

The idea is to allow one to modify the model with respect to the expected 
symmetry and desired accuracy of the parameters. Futhermore, ``ExchangeModel``
is iterable, support index access and ``in`` function.

The distances of the bonds are not directly read from the TB2J exchange file, but computed based on the atoms's positions.

:doc:`Bond <../api/_autosummary/rad_tools.exchange.bond.Bond>` class does 
not contain information about the distance. 

When exchange model is read from the TB2J exchange file the order of bonds is 
kept as the insert order of the python's dicts.

Remove double-bonds argument from :ref:`tb2j-plotter.py <tb2j-plotter>` 
script and add :ref:`--force-symmetry <tb2j-plotter_force-symmetry>` argument, 
which force the symmetry of the template to the plotted model.

Bugfix in ``force_symmetry``.
